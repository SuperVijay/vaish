   Stocks go up based on their people's perception of their future prospects.
   You need to look for clues indicating people's trust in the stock.
   Here are some clues:
   a. Price is going up on higher volumes -> green bars on big volumes
   b. Price is not coming down much on lower volumes -> red bars on low volume
   c. Price is not coming down on higer volume also -> check high-low of high volume red bar is within the high-low of prior green bars. In such case you can think of absorbing power of the buyers rather than giving up on the sellers.
   d. Recent volume buildup -> indicating increased buying, 5day SMA going up
   e. Pick only those stocks that are in general up trend - price above 50d, 200d SMA

2. Write a program to screen it:
  a. Doesn't work if you see big jumps in the stock price (like earnings announcements)
     Avoid such stocks from the screen.


Market makers will push up price on low price stocks to keep it aritificially higher to make their sales... same might work to some extent in high-volume shares as well.


Stock risk & Market risk
Look for weekly pivot points.. if the market is not going in your way, dont trade/buy new positions.
  you might continue to manage existing positions or stopped out of them.

Pivot points are weekly candle showing break of higher-high as well as higher-low.
  until that is in place, dont be in the market.

cup and handle... the handle forms with increasing volume. and falls on decreasing volume.
  Look for pivot point formation in the handle. The close should be above the high of the high of the bottom of the handle and low above the low of the bottom handle ... preferrably with volume.

Stops... if the price closes below the price of the pivot bottom, we sell the next day.


Patterns:
   cup and handle
   ,  some run up and holding on sideways on the top half of the up candles...
   , pullback (sharp pullback on decreasing volumen and pivot point on the next candle)
   , pause after large move up.


When stock goes to new high, there is nobody losing money. Once people started to making money, greed starts to take over.
People think they dont want to sell because this going to go forever...
With no resistance up, you can expect it to make fairly new highs pretty quickly.


Why support & resistance works?
  When the price falls most people won't sell. they think if they what they paid for, they want to get out of that.
  This puts pressure on recovery.


If you have a losing stock, ask yourself if you got all the money back and would you be willing to buy the stock? If not sell it.


After you put on a trade, your emotions change with the formation of each bar. This happens especially even before the next candle closes!.
as the bars go up and down during the smaller timeframes, if you are constantly watching, it is very difficutl to handle oneself in potential losing positions. Most likely you would be shaken out of the trade.

You should develop skill to group several candled to a single candle and estimate the bullishness/bearishness of that group of candles.
it will psychologically you will be more ready.


Track how much time it is taking to get the closing point.. you made some money and perhaps it tokk 26 candles.. and there are up and down days.
These trades tend to watch the candles unfold and continue to analyze what it means to their trade.
This constant analysis can lead the trader to change his behavior and modify the trade in some fashion.

Dont live candle by candle.
many good trades dont go to target immediately. This impatience can lead to modifying / exiting the trade.
Candlestick math can help overcome this from psychological perspective.

learn to deal with noise.


Bullish/Bearish belt hold line -- A long bullish candled that opens on its low and closes near its high without creating a large shadow.
Hammer -- small real body, either bullish/bearish with a long lower shadow that is 2 times the height of the real body, with little or no shadow at the top. Possible reversal after extended bearish move.
Shooting star -- same as above,, long upper shadow and little or no bottom shadow. Possible reversal signal after extended bullish move.

Barish harami -- large real body bullish candle followed by an inside bar small bearish candle.
   normally considered bearish pattern after an uptrend or extended bullish move. It is essentially a shooting star.
Bullish Harami  essentially a hammer

Dark cloud cover --  a large real body bullish candle followed by bearish candle with gap open higher and closes back down well inside first bar's real body.
       -- essentially a shooting star.
Piercing pattern  -- just a hammer.

  close past 50% point.
